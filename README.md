# webimage

A simple image resizer built for the web. If any of the features are oddly specific, it is because it is meant for my personal use. I was trying to scale images to match different screen sizes for my websites and wished there was an automated script available that allowed me to resize images easily and quickly. I decided to share it and hopefully you'll find this utility helpful.
