# webimage

A simple image resizer built for the web. If any features are oddly specific, this is because it is meant for my personal use. I was trying to scale images to match different screen sizes for my websites and wished there was an automated script available that allowed me to resize images easily and quickly. Hopefully you'll find this utility helpful.
